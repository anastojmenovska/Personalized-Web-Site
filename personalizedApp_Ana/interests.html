            <p> Dancing hip hop has always been more than just a hobby for me. It's a form of art that allows me to tell a story without uttering a single word, connecting with audiences on a visceral level. Being a part of hip hop competitions and shows has been an exhilarating journey. The thrill of stepping onto the stage, the anticipation that builds before the music starts, and the rush of adrenaline as I hit each move with precisionâ€”these experiences have been some of the most rewarding in my life. Teaching dance classes has been another deeply fulfilling aspect of my dance journey.There's a unique joy in passing on knowledge, techniques, and the sheer joy of dance. However, as much as I adore the dance world, balancing my passion for hip hop with the demands of school has become increasingly challenging. While I may not be as involved in the dance world right now, I carry the lessons and memories with me. Dance will always be a part of me, and I am excited for the future when I can reunite with the hip hop world with renewed energy and dedication.</p>

        <div class="singing">
            <p>I've been singing my whole life at home, where music has always been a part of our everyday routine. It wasn't until my dance teacher overheard me singing one day that this private passion took a public turn. Recognizing my potential, she encouraged me to perform at our next dance show. It was an incredible opportunity, blending my love for singing with my dance. Despite the encouragement and support from my teacher and peers, the thought of taking singing seriously and sharing this intimate part of myself with a wider audience was overwhelming. Even though l didn't sing again in an audience, l sing every day in my life at home. </p>

            <p>In my free time, I love to unwind by playing on my PlayStation. It's a great way to relax. My absolute favorite game is Fortnite. Whether I'm playing solo or teaming up with friends, every match is a new experience. Fortnite has become my go-to escape, where I can have fun.</p>

                In my free time, there's nothing I love more than indulging in a bit of retail therapy, especially when it comes to clothes and makeup. I'm always on the lookout for pieces that express my style and add a fresh touch to my wardrobe. Fashion allows me to play with different styles,colors.Similarly, makeup provides a canvas for me to experiment with various looks. This creative process is not just about following trends, it's about showcasing my personality and mood. Each piece of clothing and every brushstroke of makeup is an opportunity to express who I am and how I see the world.
